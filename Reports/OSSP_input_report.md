SSP Input Report
This report presents information about when, how and how often users interact with the "Ask A Question?" box on the portal website.

Some questions this report will answer include the following:

How often do students (1) stop after getting an automated response, (2) start a chat (after an automated response or not) and (3) browse for additional information (after an automated response or not)?
How many questions are asked on average per day/week/semester?
When (during the semester, during the week, during a typical) are the most questions asked?
How often is the bot able to provide automated responses?
How often are automated responses satisfactory to the student?
Distribution of questions: What are the most popular questions? What categories of questions emerge?
What is the distribution of questions across the user base? Is the standard deviation across users high or low?
The answers to these questions will provide insight into how students use the portal system. The University will be able to use that knowledge to make informed decisions about manpower behind the support network for the portal, along with future development of the platform.

This report can be tied to others to provide an overall picture of the effectiveness of the platform and the speed of the support system.
